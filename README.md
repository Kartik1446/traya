# 🚆 Traya – AI-Powered Train Scheduling & Passenger Tracking System

> **Traya** is an indigenous, AI-driven platform that optimizes train movement using real-time data while empowering passengers—especially tourists—to track their train live with just their **ticket ID**.  
> Our dual focus on **railway efficiency** and **passenger convenience** makes Traya unique, scalable, and aligned with **Atmanirbhar Bharat**.

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Scheduling**: Predictive analytics to reduce congestion and delays.  
- **Ticket-ID Tracking**: Passengers can track live train location, ETA, and alerts.  
- **Unified Dashboard**: Operator + Passenger views for transparency and convenience.  
- **IoT Integration**: GPS, IMU, and sensors ensure reliable real-time data.  
- **Edge + Cloud Ready**: Runs on edge devices with TensorFlow Lite, scalable to cloud.  
- **Compliance Path**: Scalable toward RDSO TM/IM/448 and EN 13848 standards.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch (training), TensorFlow Lite (edge deployment), YOLOv8, OpenCV  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask/Django, REST APIs (NTES/IRCTC)  
- **Frontend**: React / Flutter for web and mobile dashboards  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB for train and passenger mapping  
- **IoT Layer**: GPS, IMU, Axle Encoder, Cameras, Edge Compute (Jetson/Raspberry Pi)  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (scalable services), SCADA integration (future)

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion** → GPS, APIs, and sensors feed live train data.  
2. **AI Scheduling Engine** → Predicts conflicts, reschedules to optimize throughput.  
3. **Passenger Tracking** → Ticket-ID → Train ID → Live Status/ETA/Alerts.  
4. **Dashboard** → Operator UI + Passenger view with map and notifications.  
5. **IoT Layer** → Ensures time-sync, sensor reliability, and edge preprocessing.
